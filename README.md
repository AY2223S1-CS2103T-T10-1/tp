#Plannit

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

* **Plannit** is a **unified desktop application** that aims to **help NUS CS students manage their academic details.**

* Plannit will be the **go-to platform** for them to access all modules links and information without needing to tediously navigate through multiple websites.

* Plannit is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Plannit can help you track your module information and tasks faster than traditional GUI apps!

## Usage

* Categorize module information by modules for easier tracking!
