### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add/Delete Module

#### Implementation

A `Module` class is used to represent a module. A `Module` contains a `ModuleCode` and an 
optional `ModuleTitle`. Here are the ways in which different classes in the `Model` component interact
with `Module`:
- A `UniqueModuleList` represents the list of `Module` objects.
- The list of modules is stored in the `AddressBook` class.
- The `ModelManager` class stores the `AddressBook` containing the list of unfiltered `Module` 
  objects, and a separate instance variable storing the list of filtered `Module` objects.

The UML class diagram of the `Module`-related parts of `Model` component is shown below:

![ModelModuleClassDiagram](images/ModelModuleClassDiagram.png)

We have implemented the following `Command` classes:
- `AddModuleCommand` allows the user to add a module to Plannit.
- `DeleteModuleCommand` allows the user to delete a module from Plannit.

The Storage component has been updated for persistent storage of modules. `JsonAdaptedModule` 
has been added to represent a `Module` object in JSON format.

Below shows a description of an example scenario for adding a command. Deletion of a command is 
similar except that the corresponding deletion class is used instead. 

Step 1: User enters command `add-module m/CS2105` to add module CS2105 to Plannit.

Step 2: `addressBookParser`, the parser for Plannit, will parse the user command to return an 
`AddModuleCommand` object.

Step 3: The resulting `AddModuleCommand` object is then executed. The validity of the input 
module code provided is checked. This involves a check of whether the input is a duplicate module 
(case-insensitive, removing leading and trailing whitespaces). 

Step 4: After successful checks, the module `CS2105` will be added into Plannit. 

Step 5: The `saveAddressBook()` method of `StorageManager` is called to save the newly-updated list
of modules to a JSON file. 

Step 6: `JsonAddressBookStorage` is called, which serializes/converts the new list of modules 
into JSON format, so that it can be saved into a file. The file will be read whenever Plannit 
starts up so that it can load saved module and person data.

Step 7: Plannit Graphical User Interface (GUI) displays message that the addition of module has 
been successful. 

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user requests to add module to 
Plannit via `add-module` command.

![AddModuleActivityDiagram](images/AddModuleActivityDiagram.png)

#### Alternatives Considered

Aspect: The class-level design of how to integrate the `Module` class to the `Model` component.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reuse the same `AddressBook` to also store the list of 
  unique `Module` objects.

    * Pros: A duplicate class `AddressBook` for `Model` methods is not necessary.

    * Cons: `AddressBook`, `ModelManager` and other classes would need to be updated to include 
`Module`. Hence, the interfaces `ReadOnlyAddressBook` and `Model` also need to be updated to support
the `Module`-related methods.

* **Alternative 2:** Create another `AddressBook`-like class to store the list of `Module` objects.

    * Pros: Functionality for `Person` and `Module` are now separate. This better adheres to the 
Single Responsibility Principle because `AddressBook` only does operations regarding `Person` 
rather than doing operations regarding both `Person` and `Module`.

    * Cons: More classes to implement. In particular, `AddressBook` and `ReadOnlyAddressBook` 
need to be duplicated into separate classes to support `Module`.

Rationale behind current choice: 
1. Duplicating `AddressBook` will result in duplicating dependent classes such as 
`ReadOnlyAddressBook`, `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonSerializableAddressBook`, hence complicating
the implementation. For example, the storage component will now need to deal with two `AddressBook` 
instances, hence requiring either two separate storage files, or changing the implementation 
to combine the contents of the two different `AddressBook`-like classes into one file. Combining 
`Person` and `Module` into one `AddressBook` would avoid this issue.
2. While dealing with lists of `Person` and `Module` objects are two different functionalities, 
both functionalities deal with a list of user-provided objects. Therefore, the cohesion should not 
significantly decrease.

### \[Coming soon\] Add person to module

A person can take several modules. The relationship between `Person` and `Model` is displayed 
in the Object Oriented Domain Model diagram below:

![ModulePersonObjectOrientedDomainModel](images/ModulePersonObjectOrientedDomainModel.png)

### Add/delete/swap task feature

#### Implementation

The add/delete/swap task mechanism is facilitated by a `TaskList` data. Each
`Module` within the `UniqueModuleList` stores a `TaskList` instance, which
in turn stores a list of `Task` objects. Each `Module` is instantiated with
an empty `TaskList`.

![TaskListClassDiagram](images/AddDeleteSwapTaskFeature/TaskListClassDiagram.png)

Similar to `UniqueModuleList` and `UniquePersonList`, a `TaskList` contains the following:
* `internaList` - An `ObservableList<>` containing the tasks
  of a module. This list is used for the adding and removing of objects in
  the data structure.
* `internaUnmodifiableList` - An `ObservableList<>` that is
  an **unmodifiable** copy of `internalList`. This list is used when external
  objects requests a copy of the current list of objects.

However, there exists two key differences:
1. `TaskList` is used to store `Task` objects as opposed to the storage of
   `Module` in `UniqueModuleList` and `Person` in `UniquePersonList`.
2. A different `TaskList` instance exists in each `Module` object, meaning
   multiple instances of the `TaskList` object can exist within an
   `AddressBook` instance. On the other hand, there will always be only one
   `UniqueModuleList` instance and one `UniquePersonList` instance in the
   `AddressBook` instance.

Here's a (partial) object diagram of an `AddressBook` instance:
![AddressBookObjectDiagram](images/AddDeleteSwapTaskFeature/AddressBookObjectDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
Notice that there is only one instance of `UniquePersonList` (in purple) and 
`UniqueModuleList` (in blue). However, there are two instances of `TaskList`
(in orange), corresponding to the number of modules.
</div>

We have implemented the following `Command` classes:
- `AddTaskCommand` allows the user to add a task to a specified `Module` in
  Plannit.
- `DeleteTaskCommand` allows the user to delete a task from a specified
  `Module` in Plannit.
- `SwapTaskCommand` allows the user to swap the order of `Task`s within a
  specified `Module` in Plannit.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism
behaves when a user adds a new `Task`. The behavior for the deleting and
swapping of tasks is highly similar.

**Step 1**. The user requests to add a task into a module present in Plannit by
inputting the `add-task` command followed by the `m/` flag to indicate the
module code argument and the `td/` flag indicate the task description argument.
<br>
E.g.:
```
add-task m/CS1231 td/Submit the weekly assignment
```

**Step 2**: The `LogicManager` calls the `LogicManager::execute` method on the
user input `String`.

**Step 3**: The `LogicManager::execute` method first parses the user input
`String` using the `AddressBookParser::parseCommand` method.

**Step 4**: The command word, `add-task`, is extracted from the user input and
a new `AddTaskCommandParser` is instantiated to parse the arguments.

**Step 5**: The `AddTaskCommandParser::parse` method is then called to
parse the arguments. After validating the arguments provided by the user, a
new `Task` is instantiated with the provided description.

**Step 6**: An `AddTaskToModuleDescriptor` object is then instantiated to
contain the new `Task` and `ModuleCode` of the module to add the `Task` to.

**Step 7**: This `AddTaskToModuleDescriptor` is then used to instantiate an
`AddTaskCommand` object that is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 8**: The `AddTaskCommand::execute` method is then called by the
`LogicManager`. This method will first obtain the `Module` with the
`ModuleCode` indicated by the user by calling `Model::getModule`. A copy of
the `Module`'s fields are then created.

**Step 9**: A new `Task` is then added to the copied `TaskList` field.

**Step 10**: A new `Module` is then created using the copied fields along
with the updated `TaskList` field.

**Step 11**: The `Module` currently existing in the `Model` is then
replaced with this new updated `Module` using the `Model::setModule` method.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes
the `add-task` command:

![AddTaskSequenceDiagram](images/AddDeleteSwapTaskFeature/AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: Data structure to store `Task`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Define a new `TaskList` class**
    * Pros: Methods handling the adding, deleting and maintaining of `Task`s
      can be abstracted away into the `TaskList`.
    * Cons: Additional complexities brought about by implementing a new class.

* **Alternative 2:** Store `Task` as an `ArrayList` field in `Module`.
    * Pros: `Module` can directly handle the adding, deleting and
      maintaining of its `Task`s.
    * Cons: Poor adherence to [SOLID](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/principles.html#solid-principles)
      design principles.

**Aspect: Manner of handing arguments to `AddTaskCommand` constructor:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Pass arguments as a single
  `AddTaskToModuleDescriptor` object.
    * Pros: Neater to store all arguments in a single data structure.
      Will be highly beneficial when more fields are added to a `Task`
      in the future.
    * Cons: Additional complexities brought about by implementing a new class.

* **Alternative 2:** , Pass arguments directly into the `AddTaskCommand`
  constructor
    * Pros: Simpler to implement.
    * Cons: Number of arguments taken in by the constructor will
      increase when more fields are added to a Task in the future.

### Goto module feature

#### Implementation

Goto module mechanism is facilitated by `GoToCommand`, `ModuleCodeMatchesKeywordPredicate` and `GoToCommandParser`.
It allows users to navigate to a specific module given their respective module code. <br>

It uses the following methods provided by `ModelManager` which implements the `Model` interface.
* `ModelManager::updateFilteredModuleList`: Update the current module list and filter it according to the given predicate `Predicate<Module> predicate`, reflecting the changes accordingly in the GUI
* `ModelManager::setHomeStatus`: Sets the home status of Plannit.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism
behaves when a user navigates to a module in Plannit.

**Step 1**. The user requests to navigate to a module present in the Plannit
by inputting the `goto` command followed by the module code of the module.
E.g.:
```
goto CS1231
```

**Step 2**: The `LogicManager` calls the `LogicManager::execute` method on the
user input `String`.

**Step 3**: The `LogicManager::execute` method first parses the user input
`String` into a `Command` object using the `AddressBookParser::parseCommand`
method.

**Step 4**: The command word, `goto`, is extracted from the user input and
a new `GoToCommandParser` is instantiated to parse the arguments.

**Step 5**: The `GoToCommandParser::parse` method is then called to
parse the arguments. After validating the arguments provided by the user, a
new `ModuleCodeMatchesKeywordPredicate` is instantiated with the provided module code.

**Step 6**: The `ModuleCodeMatchesKeywordPredicate` object is then used to instantiate
a `GoToCommand` object that is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 7**: The `GoToCommand::execute` method is then called by the
`LogicManager`.

**Step 8**: The current module list via `ModelManager::updateFilteredModuleList`,
filtering the module list according to the predicate object instantiated in **Step 5**.

**Step 9**: The home status is set to false via `ModelManager::SetHomeStatus`.

**Step 10**: A new `CommandResult` object is returned, indicating success.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `goto` command:

![GoToSequenceDiagram](images/GoToSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `GoToCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `GoToCommand`:

![GoToActivityDiagram](images/GoToActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How find executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Navigate to a single module by module code and updating home status.
    * Pros:
        * Provides an intuitive and more versatile way for users to navigate between modules.
        * Provides an intuitive usage of commands by limiting the scope of possible commands usable
          when out of the home page.
    * Cons: Unable to search for multiple persons with different attributes.

* **Alternative 2:** Navigate to a single module by module code.
    * Pros: Provides an intuitive and more versatile way for users to navigate between modules.
    * Cons: Might result in confusion when some commands are usable out of the home page.

* **Alternative 3:** Navigate to module by index.
    * Pros: Allows for quicker input as compared to typing out the entire module code
    * Cons: Require user to navigate back to home page before going to another module which might be unintuitive for users.

##### Rationale behind current choice:
* Alternative 1 was chosen as it provides a more intuitive way for prospective users.

* The following commands`list-module`, `find-module` are implemented to allow users to filter
  the module list via module code prefix and reset the filtered module list while in home page. <br>
  It is not meant to be used in tandem with `goto` command. Instead, `home` command should be used to navigate back to the home page
  after usage of the `goto` command.

Hence, to prevent confusion we chose Alternative 1.
