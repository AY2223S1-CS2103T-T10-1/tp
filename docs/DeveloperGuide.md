### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each 
other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-person 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` 
component for the `execute("delete-person 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-person 1` Command](images/DeletePersonSimplifiedSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for `DeletePersonCommandParser`  and `DeletePersonCommand` should 
end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the 
lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that   they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e.:
  * all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
  * all `Module` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueModuleList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Module` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` 
  represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add link feature

The 'add link' feature allows for the user to add links with corresponding aliases to a `Module` in Plannit.
Links in Plannit are represented by the `Link` class. A `Link` object contains two required fields,
a `String` URL and a `String` alias. For each Plannit `Module`, `Link` objects are stored in a `TreeSet`.

The implementation of the 'delete link' feature is highly similar to this, but without a `String` URL input.

#### Implementation

The add link mechanism is facilitated by `AddLinkCommandParser` and `AddLinkCommand`.
`AddLinkCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface to validate the `Module` and
pair link URLs with their aliases from the user input.
It then creates a `AddLinkCommand` object with the pairings for the specified `Module`.
`AddLinkCommand` extends the `Command` class to add `Link` objects into a `Module` in Plannit.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add link mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: The user decides to add a link to a current module in Plannit using the following input:
`add-link m/CS1231 l/<link URL> la/<link alias>`.

**Step 2**: The `LogicManager` calls the `LogicManager#execute()` method on the user input.
Then, the `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` method
with the user input `String` to create a `Command` object.

**Step 3**: The `AddressBookParser` finds the command keyword `add-link` in the user input.
Thus, a new `AddLinkCommandParser` object is instantiated to parse the arguments from the user input
to create a new `AddLinkCommand` object.

**Step 4**: Within the new `AddLinkCommandParser` object, the `parse` method is used on the arguments to validate
its module code, link URL, and alias. Also, it forms a new `Link` object with its link URL and alias.
A new `AddLinkCommand` is created with the module code and `Link` object, which is returned to `LogicManager`.

**Step 5**: The `AddLinkCommand#execute()` method is then called by the `LogicManager`.
This method will first obtain the `Module` object with the module code indicated by the user.
A copy of the `Module`'s fields is then created and the `Link` object is added to the copied `TreeSet` of links.

**Step 6**: A new `Module` is created with the modified and copied fields, which replaces
the original `Module` object in Plannit using the `Model#setModule()` method.

The following sequence diagram shows how the 'add link' feature works:
![AddLinkSequenceDiagram](images/AddLinkFeature/AddLinkSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** The lifeline for `AddLinkCommand` and `AddLinkCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) 
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following activity diagram shows how the 'add link' feature works:
![AddLinkActivityDiagram](images/AddLinkFeature/AddLinkActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: Link Representation:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Link objects require alias and URL.
    * Pros:
        * Fast identification, access, and deletion of links from the user's perspective.
        * Improved sorted display of links (shorter and standardised format).
    * Cons:
        * Longer time for the user to type input.
* **Alternative 2**: Link objects require URL only and its alias is an optional input.
    * Pros:
        * Greater flexibility for different user preferences.
    * Cons:
        * Inconsistent link display format
        * Slow identification, access, and deletion of links from the user's perspective.
* **Alternative 3**: Link objects require URL only and its alias is an optional input with a default alias.
    * Pros:
        * Greater flexibility for different user preferences.
    * Cons:
        * Default alias may be confusing and/or undesirable.
        * Slow identification, access, and deletion of links from the user's perspective.
* **Alternative 4**: Link objects require URL only with no alias.
    * Pros:
        * Easy to implement.
    * Cons:
        * Cluttered and unorganised display of links.
        * Slow identification, access, and deletion of links from the user's perspective.

**Aspect: Link Storage:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Link objects stored in a `TreeSet` object within `Module`.
    * Pros:
        * Consistent display order of links in Plannit.
    * Cons:
        * Harder to implement.
* **Alternative 2**: Link objects stored in a `ArrayList` object within `Module`.
    * Pros:
        * Easy to implement.
    * Cons:
        * No standardised display order of links across `Module` objects.
* **Alternative 3**: Link objects stored in a `HashSet` object within `Module`.
    * Pros:
        * Fast performance when accessing and deleting links in terms of time.
    * Cons:
        * Display order of links changes after each modification to the `HashSet` of links for a `Module`.

Rationale behind current choice:

Link Representation: Each link requires an alias and URL such that users are able to make sense of
each URL present in Plannit. By enforcing the user to select their own alias,
they are more likely to remember what each alias means in the long run.
Aliases are also especially useful in differentiating between similar named
URLs, i.e., same domain but the remainder of the url has no semantic meaning to the user (e.g. zoom links).

Link Storage: 
TreeSet was selected as to ensure a consistent sorting order across all modules such that users
will spend the least amount of the time searching for their required alias for each module,
thus boosting their productivity.

### Person component

#### General design
Every contact added into Plannit is represented as a `Person` object.
Every `Person` object has three compulsory attributes:
- `Name`
- `Email`
- `Phone`

The UML class diagram of the `Person`-related parts of the Model component is shown below:

![ModelPersonClassDiagram](images/ModelPersonClassDiagram.png)

With reference to the diagram above, here are the ways in which different classes in the Model component interact with the `Person` class:
- A `UniquePersonList` object holds all the `Person` objects in Plannit.
  - This `UniquePersonList` object is stored in the `AddressBook` class.
- The `ModelManager` class stores a filtered list of `Person` objects, which is the list used to determine which
`Person` objects to display on the GUI.

#### Delete Person Feature
One feature related to contacts is the delete person feature, where a contact is deleted from Plannit. This 
particular feature is highlighted because its implementation involves additional interactions with the `Module` 
component.

#### Implementation of delete person feature
The delete person mechanism is facilitated by `DeletePersonCommand` and `DeletePersonCommandParser`.
`DeletePersonCommandParser` parses the user input in a meaningful way and uses it to create a `DeletePersonCommand`.
`DeletePersonCommand` then calls the `Model#deletePerson()` operation, which in turn calls
`AddressBook#removePerson()` to delete a contact in Plannit.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete person mechanism behaves at each important step.
Before proceeding on with this section, it is highly recommended that you read the
[Module-Person association](#Module-and-Person-association) section to be able to fully comprehend the example scenario 
below.

**Step 1**. There currently exists 3 persons in Plannit, with 2 of them already 
added to a module.

![DeletePersonStep1ObjectDiagram](images/DeletePersonStep1ObjectDiagram.png)

**Step 2**. The user executes `delete-person 2` command and this creates a `deletePersonCommand` to delete the 2nd person 
(that is currently displayed on the GUI) in the address book. Upon execution, `UniqueModuleList#removePersonFromModules
()` and `UniquePersonList#remove()` are eventually called. `UniqueModuleList#removePersonFromModules()` removes all 
occurrences of the person in every module. 

![DeletePersonStep2ObjectDiagram](images/DeletePersonStep2ObjectDiagram.png)

**Step 3**. `UniquePersonList#remove()` removes the person from `UniquePersonList`.
Afterwards, there would no longer be any references to the deleted `Person` object, and Java will eventually remove it
from memory.

![DeletePersonStep3ObjectDiagram](images/DeletePersonStep3ObjectDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete person operation works.

![DeletePersonSequenceDiagram](images/DeletePersonSequenceDiagram.png)

### Add/Delete Module

#### Implementation

A `Module` class is used to represent a module. A `Module` contains a `ModuleCode` and an 
optional `ModuleTitle`. Here are the ways in which different classes in the `Model` component interact
with `Module`:
- A `UniqueModuleList` represents the list of `Module` objects.
- The list of modules is stored in the `AddressBook` class.
- The `ModelManager` class stores the `AddressBook` containing the list of unfiltered `Module` 
  objects, and a separate instance variable storing the list of filtered `Module` objects.

The UML class diagram of the `Module`-related parts of `Model` component is shown below:

![ModelModuleClassDiagram](images/ModelModuleClassDiagram.png)

We have implemented the following `Command` classes:
- `AddModuleCommand` allows the user to add a module to Plannit.
- `DeleteModuleCommand` allows the user to delete a module from Plannit.

The Storage component has been updated for persistent storage of modules. `JsonAdaptedModule` 
has been added to represent a `Module` object in JSON format.

Below shows a description of an example scenario for adding a command. Deletion of a command is 
similar except that the corresponding deletion class is used instead. 

**Step 1**: User enters command `add-module m/CS2105` to add module CS2105 to Plannit.

**Step 2**: `addressBookParser`, the parser for Plannit, will parse the user command to return an 
`AddModuleCommand` object.

**Step 3**: The resulting `AddModuleCommand` object is then executed. The validity of the input 
module code provided is checked. This involves a check of whether the input is a duplicate module 
(case-insensitive, removing leading and trailing whitespaces). 

**Step 4**: After successful checks, the module `CS2105` will be added into Plannit. 

**Step 5**: The `saveAddressBook()` method of `StorageManager` is called to save the newly-updated list
of modules to a JSON file. 

**Step 6**: `JsonAddressBookStorage` is called, which serializes/converts the new list of modules 
into JSON format, so that it can be saved into a file. The file will be read whenever Plannit 
starts up so that it can load saved module and person data.

**Step 7**: Plannit Graphical User Interface (GUI) displays message that the addition of module has 
been successful. 

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user requests to add module to 
Plannit via `add-module` command.

![AddModuleActivityDiagram](images/AddModuleActivityDiagram.png)

#### Alternatives Considered

Aspect: The class-level design of how to integrate the `Module` class to the `Model` component.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reuse the same `AddressBook` to also store the list of 
  unique `Module` objects.

    * Pros: A duplicate class `AddressBook` for `Model` methods is not necessary.

    * Cons: `AddressBook`, `ModelManager` and other classes would need to be updated to include 
`Module`. Hence, the interfaces `ReadOnlyAddressBook` and `Model` also need to be updated to support
the `Module`-related methods.

* **Alternative 2:** Create another `AddressBook`-like class to store the list of `Module` objects.

    * Pros: Functionality for `Person` and `Module` are now separate. This better adheres to the 
Single Responsibility Principle because `AddressBook` only does operations regarding `Person` 
rather than doing operations regarding both `Person` and `Module`.

    * Cons: More classes to implement. In particular, `AddressBook` and `ReadOnlyAddressBook` 
need to be duplicated into separate classes to support `Module`.

Rationale behind current choice: 
1. Duplicating `AddressBook` will result in duplicating dependent classes such as 
`ReadOnlyAddressBook`, `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonSerializableAddressBook`, hence complicating
the implementation. For example, the storage component will now need to deal with two `AddressBook` 
instances, hence requiring either two separate storage files, or changing the implementation 
to combine the contents of the two different `AddressBook`-like classes into one file. Combining 
`Person` and `Module` into one `AddressBook` would avoid this issue.
2. While dealing with lists of `Person` and `Module` objects are two different functionalities, 
both functionalities deal with a list of user-provided objects. Therefore, the cohesion should not 
significantly decrease.

### Module and Person association

A person can take several modules. To model this interaction, every person in Plannit thus has the ability to be
associated to a module. The relationship between `Person` and `Model` is displayed in the Object Oriented Domain Model diagram below:

![ModulePersonObjectOrientedDomainModel](images/ModulePersonObjectOrientedDomainModel.png)

#### Add Person To Module Feature
One feature related to the module-person association is the add person to module feature. The feature allows an already
existing contact in Plannit to have an association with a module. This particular feature is highlighted because it is 
an implementation that involves interactions between two different kinds of `Model` objects, namely `Person` and 
`Module`. Note that the implementation of this feature is largely similar to the other feature under this section,
namely the delete person from module feature.

#### Implementation of add person to module feature
The add person to module mechanism is facilitated by `AddPersonToModuleCommand` and `AddPersonToModuleCommandParser`.
`AddPersonToModuleCommandParser` parses the user input in a meaningful way and uses it to create a `AddPersonToModuleCommand`.
`AddPersonToModuleCommand` then calls the `Model#getModuleUsingModuleCode()` and `Model#getPersonUsingName()` operations
to obtain the concerned module and person instances. Note that the specified instances must be in the currently filtered
display lists, else an exception is thrown. The obtained module instance is then copied over and used to construct a 
new module object. Finally, the person instance of concern is added to the newly created module object, and we then replace
the old module object in `UniqueModuleList` with the new module object.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add person to module mechanism behaves at each important step.

**Step 1**. There currently exists 2 persons (Alan and Emma) in Plannit, and the user wants to add an association 
between Alan and the module CS2106.

![AddPersonToModuleStep1ObjectDiagram](images/AddPersonToModuleStep1ObjectDiagram.png)

**Step 2**. The user executes `add-person-to-module m/CS2106 n/Alan` command and this creates a 
`addPersonToModuleCommand`. Upon execution, `Model#getModuleUsingModuleCode()` and `Model#getPersonUsingName()` are used
to obtain the existing CS2106 module and Alan person instances. `AddPersonToModuleCommand#createModuleWithAddedPerson()`
is then called to create a new CS2106 module instance by copying all fields of the old CS2106 instance and also adding 
the Alan person instance in.

![AddPersonToModuleStep2ObjectDiagram](images/AddPersonToModuleStep2ObjectDiagram.png)

**Step 3**. `Model#setModule()` replaces the old CS2106 instance with the new CS2106 instance in `UniqueModuleList`.
Afterwards, there would no longer be any references to the old CS2106 object, and Java will eventually remove it
from memory.

![AddPersonToModuleStep3ObjectDiagram](images/AddPersonToModuleStep3ObjectDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: Implementation direction:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Store `Person` as a `Set` field in `Module`.
    * Pros: No need for extra classes, making it easier to implement.
    * Cons: Does not fully model the bidirectional relationship that a module has with a person.

* **Alternative 2:** Store `Person` as a `Set` field in `Module` and at the same time, store `Module` as a `Set` field
  in `Person`
    * Pros: The bidirectional relationship is fully reflected in code.
    * Cons: Harder to implement as deleting a module object now requires deletion of that module in every person's set
      of modules as well.

* **Alternative 3:** Have an association class that models the "person is taking module" association.
  * Pros: The dependencies of the `Module` and `Person` class does not increase as no direct reference to the other type
    is now required.
  * Cons: Harder to implement as this requires creation of new classes and many more test cases.

Rationale behind current choice:
1. Despite the benefit of having code that fully reflects the relationship in the real world, going for a simpler 
  implementation helps to reduce code complexity and lowers risk of bugs.
2. Despite the benefit of having lower dependencies, the use of an association class substantially increases the risk of
  bugs as the implementation would be very different from existing (heavily-tested) code.


### Task component

#### Implementation

A `Task` class is used to represent a task that is to be completed by the 
user. Tasks are assigned to a specific module. The following `Command` 
classes were implemented to allow users to interact with `Task` objects:
- `AddTaskCommand` allows the user to add a task to a specified `Module` in
  Plannit.
- `DeleteTaskCommand` allows the user to delete a task from a specified
  `Module` in Plannit.
- `SwapTaskCommand` allows the user to swap the order of `Task`s within a
  specified `Module` in Plannit.

Each `Module` within the `UniqueModuleList` stores a `TaskList` 
instance, which in turn stores a list of `Task` objects. This `TaskList` 
object is used to maintain the list of `Task` objects within the module by 
supporting operations to add, delete and swap tasks.

![TaskListClassDiagram](images/AddDeleteSwapTaskFeature/TaskListClassDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:**  All `Module` objects are instantiated with an empty `TaskList`.
</div>

Similar to `UniqueModuleList` and `UniquePersonList`, a `TaskList` contains the following:
* `internaList` - An `ObservableList<>` containing the tasks
  of a module. This list is used for the adding and removing of objects in
  the data structure.
* `internaUnmodifiableList` - An `ObservableList<>` that is
  an **unmodifiable** copy of `internalList`. This list is used when external
  objects requests a copy of the current list of objects.

However, there exists two key differences:
1. `TaskList` is used to store `Task` objects as opposed to the storage of
   `Module` in `UniqueModuleList` and `Person` in `UniquePersonList` 
   respectively.
2. A different `TaskList` instance exists in each `Module` object, meaning
   multiple instances of the `TaskList` object can exist within an
   `AddressBook` instance. On the other hand, there will always be only one
   `UniqueModuleList` instance and one `UniquePersonList` instance in the
   `AddressBook` instance.

Here's a (partial) object diagram of an `AddressBook` instance to 
demonstrate the above point:
![AddressBookObjectDiagram](images/AddDeleteSwapTaskFeature/AddressBookObjectDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
There is only one instance of `UniquePersonList` (in purple) and 
`UniqueModuleList` (in blue). However, there are two instances of `TaskList`
(in orange), corresponding to the number of modules.
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism
behaves when a user adds a new `Task` with the `add-task` command. The behavior 
for the deleting and swapping of tasks is highly similar.

**Step 1**. The user requests to add a task into a module present in Plannit by
inputting the `add-task` command followed by the `m/` flag to indicate the
module code argument and the `td/` flag indicate the task description argument.
<br>
E.g.:
```
add-task m/CS1231 td/Submit the weekly assignment
```

**Step 2**: The `LogicManager` uses the `AddressBookParser`  and 
`AddTaskCommandParser` to parse the user input. After validating the
arguments provided by the user, the `ModuleCode` of the module to add the
task to and the task description of the new task is extracted by the `AddTaskCommandParser`.

**Step 3**: An `AddTaskToModuleDescriptor` object is then instantiated to
contain the extracted `ModuleCode` and a new `Task` with the extracted task 
description.

**Step 4**: This `AddTaskToModuleDescriptor` is used to instantiate an
`AddTaskCommand` object that is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 5**: The `AddTaskCommand#execute()` method is then called by the
`LogicManager`. This method will first obtain the `Module` with the
`ModuleCode` indicated by the user by calling `Model#getModule()`. A copy of
the `Module`'s fields are then created.

**Step 6**: A new `Task` is then added to the copied `TaskList` field.

**Step 7**: A new `Module` is then created using the copied fields along
with the updated `TaskList` field.

**Step 8**: The `Module` currently existing in the `Model` is then
replaced with this new updated `Module` using the `Model#setModule()` method.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes
the `add-task` command:

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** The lifeline for `AddTaskCommand`,  and `AddTaskCommandParser` should 
end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: Data structure to store `Task`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Define a new `TaskList` class**
    * Pros: Methods handling the adding, deleting and maintaining of `Task`s
      can be abstracted away into the `TaskList`.
    * Cons: Additional complexities brought about by implementing a new class.

* **Alternative 2:** Store `Task` as an `ArrayList` field in `Module`.
    * Pros: `Module` can directly handle the adding, deleting and
      maintaining of its `Task`s.
    * Cons: Poor adherence to [SOLID](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/principles.html#solid-principles)
      design principles.

Rationale behind current choice:
1. Despite the additional complexities, it is good practice to adhere with the 
SOLID design principles. 
2. Furthermore, the additional complexities and potential for new bugs can
   be mitigated by robust unit and integration testing.

**Aspect: Manner of handing arguments to `AddTaskCommand` constructor:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Pass arguments as a single
  `AddTaskToModuleDescriptor` object.
    * Pros: Neater to store all arguments in a single data structure.
      Will be highly beneficial when more fields are added to a `Task`
      in the future.
    * Cons: Additional complexities brought about by implementing a new class.

* **Alternative 2:** Pass arguments directly into the `AddTaskCommand`
  constructor
    * Pros: Simpler to implement.
    * Cons: Number of arguments taken in by the constructor will
      increase when more fields are added to a `Task` in the future.

Rationale behind current choice:

1. Despite the additional complexities, a `Task` object is likely to have 
additional fields (e.g. `Date`, `Priority`) in future iterations. Should we 
pass fields directly in to the constructor as arguments, the number of 
parameters in the constructor would increase. This would greatly affect the 
readability of the code. 
2. The additional complexities and potential for new bugs can be mitigated 
   by robust unit and integration testing.

### Goto module feature

#### Implementation

Goto module mechanism is facilitated by `GoToCommand`, `ModuleCodeMatchesKeywordPredicate` and `GoToCommandParser`.
It allows users to navigate to a specific module given their respective module code. <br>

It uses the following methods provided by `ModelManager` which implements the `Model` interface.
* `ModelManager#updateFilteredModuleList()`: Update the current module list and filter it according to the given predicate `Predicate<Module> predicate`, reflecting the changes accordingly in the GUI
* `ModelManager#setHomeStatus()`: Sets the home status of Plannit.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism
behaves when a user navigates to a module in Plannit.

**Step 1**. The user requests to navigate to a module present in the Plannit
by inputting the `goto` command followed by the module code of the module.
E.g.:
```
goto CS1231
```

**Step 2**: The `LogicManager` calls the `LogicManager#execute()` method on the
user input `String`.

**Step 3**: The `LogicManager#execute()` method first parses the user input
`String` into a `Command` object using the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`
method.

**Step 4**: The command word, `goto`, is extracted from the user input and
a new `GoToCommandParser` is instantiated to parse the arguments.

**Step 5**: The `GoToCommandParser#parse()` method is then called to
parse the arguments. After validating the arguments provided by the user, a
new `ModuleCodeMatchesKeywordPredicate` is instantiated with the provided module code.

**Step 6**: The `ModuleCodeMatchesKeywordPredicate` object is then used to instantiate
a `GoToCommand` object that is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 7**: The `GoToCommand#execute()` method is then called by the
`LogicManager`.

**Step 8**: The current module list via `ModelManager#updateFilteredModuleList()`,
filtering the module list according to the predicate object instantiated in **Step 5**.

**Step 9**: The home status is set to false via `ModelManager#SetHomeStatus()`.

**Step 10**: A new `CommandResult` object is returned, indicating success.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `goto` command:

![GoToSequenceDiagram](images/GoToSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `GoToCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `GoToCommand`:

![GoToActivityDiagram](images/GoToActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How find executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Navigate to a single module by module code and updating home status.
    * Pros:
        * Provides an intuitive and more versatile way for users to navigate between modules.
        * Provides an intuitive usage of commands by limiting the scope of possible commands usable
          when out of the home page.
    * Cons: Unable to search for multiple persons with different attributes.

* **Alternative 2:** Navigate to a single module by module code.
    * Pros: Provides an intuitive and more versatile way for users to navigate between modules.
    * Cons: Might result in confusion when some commands are usable out of the home page.

* **Alternative 3:** Navigate to module by index.
    * Pros: Allows for quicker input as compared to typing out the entire module code
    * Cons: Require user to navigate back to home page before going to another module which might be unintuitive for users.

##### Rationale behind current choice:
* Alternative 1 was chosen as it provides a more intuitive way for prospective users.

* The following commands`list-module`, `find-module` are implemented to allow users to filter
  the module list via module code prefix and reset the filtered module list while in home page. <br>
  It is not meant to be used in tandem with `goto` command. Instead, `home` command should be used to navigate back to the home page
  after usage of the `goto` command.

Hence, to prevent confusion we chose Alternative 1.
