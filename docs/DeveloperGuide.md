### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Goto module feature

#### Implementation

Goto module mechanism is facilitated by `GoToCommand`, `ModuleCodeMatchesKeywordPredicate` and `GoToCommandParser`.
It allows users to navigate to a specific module given their respective module code. <br>

It uses the following methods provided by `ModelManager` which implements the `Model` interface.
* `ModelManager::updateFilteredModuleList`: Update the current module list and filter it according to the given predicate `Predicate<Module> predicate`, reflecting the changes accordingly in the GUI
* `ModelManager::setHomeStatus`: Sets the home status of Plannit.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism
behaves when a user navigates to a module in Plannit.

**Step 1**. The user requests to navigate to a module present in the Plannit
by inputting the `goto` command followed by the module code of the module.
E.g.:
```
goto CS1231
```

**Step 2**: The `LogicManager` calls the `LogicManager::execute` method on the
user input `String`.

**Step 3**: The `LogicManager::execute` method first parses the user input
`String` into a `Command` object using the `AddressBookParser::parseCommand`
method.

**Step 4**: The command word, `goto`, is extracted from the user input and
a new `GoToCommandParser` is instantiated to parse the arguments.

**Step 5**: The `GoToCommandParser::parse` method is then called to
parse the arguments. After validating the arguments provided by the user, a
new `ModuleCodeMatchesKeywordPredicate` is instantiated with the provided module code.

**Step 6**: The `ModuleCodeMatchesKeywordPredicate` object is then used to instantiate
a `GoToCommand` object that is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 7**: The `GoToCommand::execute` method is then called by the
`LogicManager`.

**Step 8**: The current module list via `ModelManager::updateFilteredModuleList`,
filtering the module list according to the predicate object instantiated in **Step 5**.

**Step 9**: The home status is set to false via `ModelManager::SetHomeStatus`.

**Step 10**: A new `CommandResult` object is returned, indicating success.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `goto` command:

![GoToSequenceDiagram](images/GoToSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `GoToCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `GoToCommand`:

![GoToActivityDiagram](images/GoToActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How find executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Navigate to a single module by module code and updating home status.
    * Pros:
        * Provides an intuitive and more versatile way for users to navigate between modules.
        * Provides an intuitive usage of commands by limiting the scope of possible commands usable
          when out of the home page.
    * Cons: Unable to search for multiple persons with different attributes.

* **Alternative 2:** Navigate to a single module by module code.
    * Pros: Provides an intuitive and more versatile way for users to navigate between modules.
    * Cons: Might result in confusion when some commands are usable out of the home page.

* **Alternative 3:** Navigate to module by index.
    * Pros: Allows for quicker input as compared to typing out the entire module code
    * Cons: Require user to navigate back to home page before going to another module which might be unintuitive for users.

##### Rationale behind current choice:
* Alternative 1 was chosen as it provides a more intuitive way for prospective users.

* The following commands`list-module`, `find-module` are implemented to allow users to filter
  the module list via module code prefix and reset the filtered module list while in home page. <br>
  It is not meant to be used in tandem with `goto` command. Instead, `home` command should be used to navigate back to the home page
  after usage of the `goto` command.

Hence, to prevent confusion we chose Alternative 1.
